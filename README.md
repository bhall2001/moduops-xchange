# Module Exchange

Welcome to the ModuOps module Xchange, a shared drive of modules from around the world.

## How this works

Modules are added to the Xchange by either by sending the module file to Bob Hall via email or by submitting a pull request to the [Module Xchange Github repository](https://github.com/bhall2001/moduops-xchange).

Modules in the Xchange are available to add to any layout in ModuOps. Anyone needing access to the Module Xchange can mount the Xchange to their local file system giving you direct access to all available modules.

## Google Drive

The initial release of the Xchange is being made with Google Drive. You will need to have Google Drive installed on your local system. [Follow this link](https://www.google.com/drive/download/) to download Drive for desktop if you do not already have Drive installed.


Once Drive is installed, you can access the Xchange with the following shared link:
