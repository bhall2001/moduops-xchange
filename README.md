# ModuOps Xchange

Welcome to the ModuOps Xchange, a shared drive of modules from around the world.

## How it works

Modules are added to the Xchange by sending the module file to Bob Hall via email or by submitting a pull request to the [ModuOps Xchange Github repository](https://github.com/bhall2001/moduops-xchange).

Modules in the Xchange are available to add to any layout in ModuOps. The ModuOps Xchange is mounted to your local file system providing direct access to all available modules from within ModuOps.

## Google Drive

The initial release of the ModuOps Xchange is hosted on Google Drive. Ensure you have Google Drive installed on your local system. [Download Drive for desktop here](https://www.google.com/drive/download/).

Once Drive is installed, access the ModuOps Xchange with the following shared link:
