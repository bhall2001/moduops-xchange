# Module Exchange

Welcome to the ModuOps Module Xchange, a shared drive of modules from around the world.

## How It Works

Modules are added to the Xchange by sending the module file to Bob Hall via email or by submitting a pull request to the [Module Xchange Github repository](https://github.com/bhall2001/moduops-xchange).

Modules in the Xchange are available to add to any layout in ModuOps. To access the Module Xchange, you can mount it to your local file system, providing direct access to all available modules.

## Google Drive

The initial release of the Xchange is hosted on Google Drive. Ensure you have Google Drive installed on your local system. [Download Drive for desktop here](https://www.google.com/drive/download/).

Once Drive is installed, access the Xchange with the following shared link:
